```

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 1. General Q&A

**Example Conversation:**
```
User: What is artificial intelligence?
PACA: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems
      designed to mimic intelligent human behavior. It can
      perform cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning,
      and problem-solving.

User: What are the types of AI?
PACA: AI can be broadly classified into 3 types:
      1. Narrow AI (Weak AI): Specialized for specific tasks
      2. General AI (Strong AI): Human-level general intelligence
      3. Superintelligence: Intelligence surpassing humans
```

### 2. Mathematical Calculations

**Basic Calculations:**
```
User: What is 123 × 456?
PACA: 123 × 456 = 56,088.

User: What is √(16 + 9)?
PACA: √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5.
```

**Advanced Calculations:**
```
User: Solve x² + 2x + 1 = 0
PACA: The quadratic equation x² + 2x + 1 = 0 has the solution
      x = -1 (double root). This can be factored as (x + 1)² = 0.

User: Sum of 1 to 100?
PACA: The sum of integers from 1 to 100 is 5,050.
      Formula: n(n+1)/2 = 100×101/2 = 5,050
```

### 3. Logical Reasoning

**Syllogistic Reasoning:**
```
User: All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Therefore?
PACA: Logically, the conclusion would be "Penguins can fly."
      However, in reality, penguins cannot fly.
      This is because the first premise "All birds can fly"
      is factually incorrect.

      Confidence: Logical validity 100%, Real-world applicability 0%
```

**Complex Reasoning:**
```
User: If it rains, we need an umbrella. It's very cloudy today.
      Cloudy weather increases the chance of rain. What's the conclusion?
PACA: Reasoning chain:
      1. It's very cloudy (given fact)
      2. Cloudy weather → high chance of rain
      3. If it rains → umbrella needed

      Conclusion: You should prepare an umbrella today.
      Confidence: 75% (considering weather prediction uncertainty)
```

### 4. Learning & Memory

**Conversation Memory:**
```
User: My name is John Smith.
PACA: Hello John Smith! I'll remember that.

(Later...)
User: What was my name again?
PACA: You told me your name is John Smith.
```

**Preference Learning:**
```
User: I love solving math problems.
PACA: I'll remember that you enjoy mathematics.
      I'll provide more detailed mathematical explanations
      in the future.

User: Give me a simple problem.
PACA: Since you mentioned you love math, John,
      how about this problem:
      "If a number squared equals 64, what is the number?"
```

✅ Good: "Solve the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0"

❌ Poor: "Programming"
✅ Good: "How do I sort a list in Python?"
```

#### 2. Provide Context
```
❌ Poor: "Is this correct?"
✅ Good: "When x = 3, is 2x + 1 = 7 correct?"

❌ Poor: "What do you think?"
✅ Good: "What are your thoughts on the claim that AI
         will replace human jobs?"
```

#### 3. Step-by-Step Approach
```
For complex problems, break them down:
Step 1: "What is calculus?"
Step 2: "Please explain the concept of limits"
Step 3: "What is the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0?"
```
